# Pocket Script Cards Overview

**Pocket Script Cards** is a project designed to help people to easily memorize the fundamental characteristics of some popular programming languages and tools (that I personally use). 
It focuses first and foremost on programming languages, their Standard Libraries, 
and some useful third-party Libraries, Frameworks or 3D Engines. 
The philosophy behind this approach is that reading code is one of the most effective way to improve one's programming skills, second only to writing the code yourself. 

Of course, those cards are designed to be read inside some text editors such as Visual Studio Code or IDE like Visual Studio. 

# Technologies 
- Assembly (MIPS): Fundamentals
- C: Fundamentals • Standard Library 
- C++: Fundamentals • Standard Library • Unreal Engine
- Java: Fundamentals
- Python: Fundamentals • Python Standard Library
- Web: HTML • CSS & SASS/ SCSS • JavaScript • PHP

# On 3D Engines 
For Unity and Unreal Engine, due to the very huge number of files (even for a blank project), 
only the scripts are uploaded. You will need to create a blank Unity or Unreal project, and 
import these scripts.
