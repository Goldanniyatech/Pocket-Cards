# Pocket Script Cards Overview

**Pocket Script Cards** is a project designed to help people to easily memorize the fundamental characteristics of some popular programming languages and tools (that I personally use). 
It focuses first and foremost on programming languages, their Standard Libraries, and some useful third-party Libraries, Frameworks or 3D Engines. 
The philosophy behind this approach is that reading code is one of the most effective way to improve one's programming skills, second only to writing the code yourself (hence, writing your own pocket cards would be even more effective. Then, consider it just as a blueprint for your own project). 

In order to enhance each card provided with real-life examples, a small textual mini-game will be included, whenever possible.  

Of course, those cards are designed to be read within text editors such as Visual Studio Code (or like Visual Studio, intelliJ, etc.), which differ quite a lot from notebooks like Jupyter. Additionally, I strive to maintain a limit of 1,000 lines per card for readability purposes.

# On 3D Engines 
For Unity and Unreal Engine, due to the very huge number of files (even for a blank project), 
only the scripts are uploaded. You will need to create a blank Unity or Unreal project, and 
import these scripts. 
For older engines (Panda3D, JMonkey or Irrlicht), I only added the scripts and a couple of dummy 3D items.
