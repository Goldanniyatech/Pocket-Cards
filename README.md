# Pocket Cards Overview

**Pocket Cards** is a project aimed at helping to easily memorize (or remember) the fundamental characteristics of programming languages I heavily use. 
It focuses on the core aspect of programming languages, then extends to each Standard Library, 
and finally ads some extremely useful third-party Libraries, Frameworks or 3D Engines (based in my opinion, at least)

# Technologies 
- C: Fundamentals • Standard Library 
- C++: Fundamentals • Standard Library • Unreal Engine
- Java
- Python: Fundamentals • Python Standard Library
- Web: HTML • CSS & SASS/ SCSS • JavaScript • PHP
